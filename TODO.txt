==== Checkpoint 1
X * Refactor tweet/conversations into tableless models
X * Summarize conversation-- summarize gem was looking like a rabbit hole getting glib and libxml2 working on windows and heroku, so I'm going with hashtag then most frequent noun phrase according to the POS tagged text from EngTagger
X * Conversation header text - users and topic
X * Link dereferencing and collapsing
X * RTs with added text -- collapse into conversation as replies
==== Checkpoint 2
* Non-native RTs/multiple independent RTs of same text -- collapse
* Get 800 tweets instead of 200 by getting multiple pages of tweets
* Performance - profile #digest and see if improvements can be made
* Conversation collapsing - jquery
* Make display more twitter-like: pictures, <hr>s, etc
* Change to Reader's twigest?
